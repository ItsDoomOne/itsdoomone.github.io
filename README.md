# Doom's personal website

This website was intended to mimic the style of 90s personal websites

## Repo Contents:
Several Bible translations at /bibles/ or at https://doom.is-a.dev/bible.html \
Scripts that can be ran from the terminal using a CURL command\
Games\
Stuff on public domain\


## Relevant Info
Some pages are work in progress, mostly pages in the new/ folder.\
Working on a new website, enhanced and prettier (the 90s do not fit me, atleast not the website designs)\
