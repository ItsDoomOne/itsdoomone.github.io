Here's a way of forwarding iOS's and Android's microphones to Linux.
In this guide, i'm using Fedora 42 which uses PipeWire.
Firstly, install Flatpak and pavucontrol.
Generally, its something like
'sudo dnf install flatpak pavucontrol'
'sudo apt install flatpak pavucontrol'
'sudo pacman -S flatpak pavucontrol'

Point is: install that stuff

After that, add flathub support.
Search up your distro here and follow the guide: https://flathub.org/setup
Generally its something like 'flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo'
With flathub added, run 'flatpak install flathub net.sonobus.SonoBus'
It will install SonoBus, it uses P2P (peer-to-peer) to forward audio. Like a voicecall.
Also install it on your phone.

After that, create a virtual device:

pactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=SonoBus sink_properties=device.description=SonoBus
pactl load-module module-remap-source master=virtualmic-sink.monitor source_name=SonoBus source_properties=device.description=Sonobus

After that, open SonoBus and set it up. Create a group and enter it in both devices. Mute yourself on the PC.
Later, open pavucontrol and forward the output from sonobus to the virtual device. 
And finally, choose SonoBus as input for the app you want.
