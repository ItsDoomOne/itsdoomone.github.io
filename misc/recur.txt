This file's only use is to test Spew. It is included in the third line of Spew's standard STFS file (Spew Format To Standard)
This file will be used to test download through Python's module, and in the future, dotnet's capablities for making downloads.
Spew is a DSL created by me, Leonardo H.S. to help my friends solve linux problems remotely and also to facilitate downloading stuff
Spew is probably going to be used in the backend of Aspect's Aspect11 windows mod, once i port PySpew to C#.
For that, i will need to finalize the standard and the actual program first.
Never stop dreaming, yesterday I wasn't making this project. This could very well be my biggest project once i finish it.
